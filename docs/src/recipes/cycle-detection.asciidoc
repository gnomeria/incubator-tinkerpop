Cycle Detection
---------------

A cycle occurs in a graph where a path loops back on itself to the originating vertex. For example, in the graph
depticted below Gremlin could be use to detect the cycle among vertices `A-B-C`.

<1> Gremlin starts its traversal from a vertex labeled "a" and traverses `out()` from each vertex filtering on the
`simplePath`, which removes paths with repeated objects. The steps going `out()` are repeated twice as in this case
the length of the cycle is known to be three and there is no need to exceed that. The traversal filters with a
`where()` to see only return paths that end with where it started at "a".
<2> The previous query returned the `A-B-C` cycle, but it returned three paths which were all technically the same
cycle. It returned three, because there was one for each vertex that started the cycle (i.e. one for `A`, one for `B`
and one for `C`). This next line introduce deduplication to only return unique cycles.

The above case assumed that the need was to only detect cycles over a path length of three. It also respected the
directionality of the edges by only considering outgoing ones. What would need to change to detect cycles of
arbitrary length over both incoming and outgoing edges in the modern graph?
