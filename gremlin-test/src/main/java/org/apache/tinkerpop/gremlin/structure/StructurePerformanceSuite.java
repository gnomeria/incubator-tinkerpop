/**
 * The {@code StructurePerformanceSuite} is a JUnit test runner that executes the Gremlin Test Suite over a
 * {@link Graph} implementation. This suite contains "long-run" tests that produce reports on the read/write
 * performance of a providers implementation {@link Graph}. Its usage is optional to providers as the tests are
 * somewhat redundant to those found elsewhere in other required test suites.
 * <p/>
 * For more information on the usage of this suite, please see {@link StructureStandardSuite}.
